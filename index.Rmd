Ecologic study of association between crime rate and drug use in U.S. 





### *The motivation for this project*
 * Explore the association between rate of different types of crime and abuse of four kinds of drugs and build a regression model for different crimes by state level.
 * Study distributions of crimes and drug use in each state and conclude which pair of crime and drug use is highly related in each state
 * Analyze data from 2002 to 2016 to conduct hypothesis test of the trend of crime rate and drug use as well as to make predictions.
 * Draw a map across U.S. about detailed data of crime rate and drug use in each state
