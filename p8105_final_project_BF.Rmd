Proposal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **Group members**

Jieqi Tu (jt3098), Mengran Ma (mm5354),

* **The tentative project title**

Ecologic study of association between crime rate and drug use in U.S. 

* **The motivation for this project**
 * Explore the association between rate of different types of crime and abuse of four kinds of drugs and build a regression model for different crimes by state level.
 * Study distributions of crimes and drug use in each state and conclude which pair of crime and drug use is highly related in each state
 * Analyze data from 2002 to 2016 to conduct hypothesis test of the trend of crime rate and drug use as well as to make predictions.
 * Draw a map across U.S. about detailed data of crime rate and drug use in each state 


* **The intended final products**

A github.io website containing all the analyses and information about our final project, which includes the following: 

1. Plots and tables that may help us better understand/visualize the distribution of drug use among different states here in the U.S. and across all different levels of age.

2. Statistical summaries/numerical values and perhaps in combination with geographical maps for summarizing each individual ratio of committing different type of crimes acorss various states (state by state) in the U.S.

3. Regression model/analyses where we are trying to predict if there is any trend for having association between rate of different types of crime and abuse of four kinds of drugs and build a regression model for different crimes by state level. Also we explore which pair of crime and drug use is highly related in each state.

* **The anticipated data sources**

For this project we will use two datasets: one dataset("crime-data-2016.xls") recorded crime rates in the United States in 2016; the other dataset("drugs.csv") contains information of drug use among different age groups across states.

The crime dataset was derived from the Uniform Crime Reporting(UCR) program by FBI. The program collects real-world data for crime rate and law enforcement, and generates annual report. Here we will use the data from 2015 to 2016. The dataset for drug use was obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health(NSDUH), which provides up-to-date survey results on alcohol, tabacco, drug use, etc.

#### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

**The planned analyses**
  
  * Analyze the distribution of crime data in each state in the U.S.
  
  * Analyze the distribution of drug data in each state in the U.S. 
  
  * Explore the relationship between drug use and crime rate in each state.
  
  * Make linear regression models of crime-drug data.
  
  * If the R-squared is too low, try using other transformations.
  
  * If other transformations also do not work well, try using piecewise regression or non-linear regression.

  
**Visualizations**

  * Heat map of different drug use for different states.
  
  * Heat map of different crime rate for different states.
  
  * Linear regression plots of crime-drug (respectively).
    

  
**Coding challenges**

  * For visualization:
    
    * Making plots consists of different types of crimes or drug uses may be challenging.

    
#### The planned timeline
    
  * Week 1: Data cleaning; Data exploring; Discussion on work splitting.
  * Week 2: Data analysis and group meetings on revisions.
  * Week 3: Plots making and group meetings on revisions.
  * Week 4: Website building and dashboard making; In-class discussion with other gourps.
