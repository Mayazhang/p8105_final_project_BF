Proposal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Section 1

* **Group members**

Bingyu Sun (bs3142), Hongyao Xie (hx2264), 

Jieqi Tu (jt3098), Mengran Ma (mm5354), 

Xiaoyue Zhang (xz2788)

* **The tentative project title**

Retail trend and consumer habits of Black Friday

* **The motivation for this project**

1. study the retail trend and discount strength on each type of product on Black Friday

2. find the model of consumer habits including the time of shopping, the number of products purchased, city of residence, age, etc.

3. predict the most worthy-to-buy products on Black Friday based on our results and come up with suggestion for Black Friday shopping

### Section 2

* **The intended final products**

A github.io website containing all the analyses and information about our final project, which includes the following: 

1. Plots and tables that may help us better understand Black Friday deals and customers' purchasing behaviours/preferences against different products.

2. Statistical summaries/numerical values for summarizing most worthy-to-buy products on Black Friday based on our analysis and propose any suggestion for Black Friday shopping.

3. Regression model where we are trying to predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the facilitating of the information contained in the other variables.

* **The anticipated data sources**

The black Friday dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday) derived from kaggle was generated in a competition hosted by Analytics Vidhya. This dataset is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store, which aims at understanding the customer purchase behaviour against different products.

The deals dataset(https://www.bfads.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=35040) from BFAds.net contains up-to-date 2018 Black Friday deals, which could be a potential source for analyzing featured offers and latest hot sales on Black Friday at well-known stores, such as BestBuy, Targets, and Walmart.
