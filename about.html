<p>From the result we could see that, both murder/manslaughter and robbery rate are positively related to marijuana use. In addition, murder/manslaughter rate is also related to illicit drugs. So, we would look into murder/manslaughter and robbery MLR models.</p>
<p>Check the diagnostics of the model.</p>
