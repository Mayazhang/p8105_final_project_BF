<li><p>Outcomes: rates of 10 types of crimes(two main crimes: violent and property, and their subtypes)</p></li>
<li><p>Predictors: use of 3 types of drugs, ratio of white race(possible confounders), and high school graduations(possible confounders)</p></li>

<p>It was shown that both murder/manslaughter and robbery rate were positively related to marijuana use. In addition, murder/manslaughter rate was also related to illicit drugs. Therefore we would investigate deeper into MLR models for murder/manslaughter and robbery.</p>
<p>Two outliers/influential points were identified: District of Columbia(observation 9) and Hawaii(observation 14), the MLR model would be refitted without these two observations.</p>
